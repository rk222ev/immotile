Having enjoyed the world around the Clojure(script) community:
Figwheel, s-expression, immutable
data structures, functional programming, emacs and org-mode.
I've become accustomed to a certain ideas, workflows and a
level of devloper comfort.
</p>

<p>
Doing some simple blogging and other small static sites I never quite found
the same feeling of comfort as when doing other development on the server side
or developing single page applications.
Looking at what was available in the Clojure(script) world and different Emacs centered solutions
I didn't quite find was I was looking for.
</p>

<p>
Immotile was born to fill this perceived gap.
